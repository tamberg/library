# Library
A simple, small scale, low volume "library management system" based on GitHub.

> Work in progress, contact thomas.amberg@fhnw.ch

## Goals
- Keep it simple
- Use GitHub features

## Entities
<details>
<summary>Entities like items, topics, requests, etc. can be mapped to GitHub features.</summary>

### Item
A thing to be borrowed by users and lent by admins, respectively — a file in this GitHub repository.

### Topic
To group items — a hierarchical directory, or a file with links to redirect, in this GitHub repository.

### Search
To find items by group or item name — a GitHub search for a full or partial directory or file name.

### Request
To borrow this item for _n_ weeks — a new GitHub issue with the item name, user and timestamp.

### Availability
To list open requests for this item — the list of open GitHub issues filtered by the item name.

### User
Who borrows items — a GitHub user with the right to search and read files, open new issues.

### Admin
Who lends items — a GitHub user with the right to edit, add new files, label and close issues.

### Tag
For `ready`, `out`, `due`, `late` or `closed` requests — by labeling or closing a GitHub issue.
</details>

## Use cases
### Find an item
Use the GitHub (file) search, to find [an item](Hardware/Microcontrollers/Adafruit_Feather_M4_Express.md).

### Check availability
Find an item (file) to [check its availability](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%22Adafruit+Feather+M4+Express%22).

### Request an item
Find an item (file) to [borrow it](../../issues/new?title=Borrow%20request%20for%20Adafruit%20Feather%20M4%20Express&body=1%20piece%20of%20[this](../blob/main/Hardware/Microcontrollers/Adafruit_Feather_M4_Express.md)%20for%20~2%20weeks.) (new issue).

### List my requests
Log in to [see your requests](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+author%3A@me) (issues).

### List any user's requests
See any [user's requests](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+author%3AGITHUB_USER) (issues).

### List all open requests
See all [open requests](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) (issues).

### Get notified about requests
Enable _Watch > Custom > ☑ Issues_.

### Respond to a request
- Tag a request (issue) with `ready`, once the item is available.
- Add comments to reach out to the user, if necesssary.

### Hand-out an item
Tag the request (issue) with `out`.

### Recall a due item
Tag the request (issue) with `due`.

### Remind a late user
Tag the request (issue) with `late`.

### Mark a lost item
Tag the request (issue) with `lost`.

### Take back an item
Close the request (issue).

### Add an item
- Add an item (file) to a topic (directory).
- Add the item to redirecting entries (files).
- Create [pre-populated links](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34146618/pre-populate-the-github-new-issue-form-using-the-querystring) to check/borrow.

## Meta
### Automation
- CLI python script to create links?
- GitHub actions and badges?
- Use an issue [template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)?

### Limitations
- A GitHub account is required to borrow items.
- All requests, open and closed, are public.
